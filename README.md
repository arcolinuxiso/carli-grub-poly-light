## 💛 A Grateful Farewell from the ArcoLinux Team

After many years of building, sharing, and learning together, the **ArcoLinux project is winding down**.

Although no new updates or packages will be released, we are proud of the knowledge, tools, and community that have grown around ArcoLinux.

### What's Staying Online ✅

- 🌐 **Websites** will remain accessible for several years
- 🎥 **YouTube videos** will stay online and continue to serve as tutorials
- 📦 **GitHub repositories** like this one will remain available as long as GitHub's free hosting allows

### Keep Using and Updating Your System 🛠️

ArcoLinux was always built on **Arch Linux**, which is a **rolling release**.  
This means your system can still be installed and updated using standard Arch tools and knowledge.
